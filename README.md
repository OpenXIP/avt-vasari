Welcome to the AVT Image Annotation&trade; Project!
===================================================

The Algorithm Validation Toolkit&trade; (AVT&trade;) Open Source project is a set
of tools that facilitate the testing and statistical comparison of image processing
algorithms.  It is built upon the
[eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) development
framework, and can create and consume objects based
on [AIM (Annotation and Image Markup)] (https://github.com/NCIP/annotation-and-image-markup)
models.  

The Vasari&trade; (IA&trade;) component of AVT&trade; is an XIP-based 
[DICOM Hosted Application](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf)
for creating AIM objects associated with TCGA GBM imaging studies.  Its focus
are measurements of glioblastomas.  Vasari can be run using a
[DICOM Hosting System](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf),
such as the [XIP Host&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-host).
AVT Vasari&trade; is implemented in Java with Swing, and utilizes scene graphs
created with the [XIP Libraries&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-libraries).

The Vasari application was the precursor to the
[AVT Image Annotation&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-ia) (IA&trade;) application.
Most of the functionality of the Vasari application was folded into the AVT IA
application.  As such, Vasari is not actively maintained, with efforts more focused
on AVT IA.  It is included in the project for historical purposes.
